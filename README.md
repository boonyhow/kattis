Hi there! This folder includes my submissions to [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com). These codes were done when I started learning how to program, so it is not the best in terms of algorithm analysis and understanding! However, I am sharing this as a reminder to myself on the improvements I have made since then, and I do hope that the files may come in handy to some :)
